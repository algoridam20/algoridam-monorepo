## Chapter 1 : the unimaginable

### what is it good for ?

There is always somthing that you cannot imagine , what is it ?
imagination is just exprapolation of reality .................


### Black hole

There is a super massive black hole at the center of each galaxy.
when a galaxy is formed , there is a emergent pehnomenon, when gravity is so strong nothing can escape not even light.
Only thing that excape is life.....


in a galaxy that we live in, we have a constellation of possiblities, with each sun there is a solar system.
With each solar system there is a probablity that life can exist, and with such a large galaxy life is not rare.
Instead it is as common as an unpolised daimond.

With such large masses time is not as simple as it seems, things that can happen in a second can take years to finish.
In this adventure where all time is relative what will you do ?

I live near the super massive blackhole Sagittarius A*, unknown of the rest of the galaxy, unknown of whats out there.
There are 6 planet near our solar system all of them surrounding the super massive and we rotating aroud our god being sucked into the eternal hell.
Hell and Heven are highly primitive way intelligent life justlify the existance, we have been over this for centuries and milleniaans. There is no god there is no hell this is all we have till all the information of our existance is lost on the surface of super massive.
